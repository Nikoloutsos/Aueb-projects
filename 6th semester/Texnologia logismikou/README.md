An android project implemented with MVP design pattern. It contains unit tests with good code coverage.

Texnologia logismikou did not really help me improve my technical programming skills. But I enjoy it because I learned how to use gitlab(did not even know it before) and how to organize my code for making it more maintainable. Also we saw how Continuous integration works in theory and we talked about agile scrum, waterfall.

Domain model, UML class diagrams, activity diagrams were taught and asked from us to implement them in the project.
Application's goal looks pretty clear when you have made those diagrams.

It is a good lesson overall for a software engineer but if you are not a guy who prefer attending lectures I suggest you read this book(it contains everything you need to know with more examples and better approach) [Clean code by Uncle BOB](https://www.bookdepository.com/Clean-Code-Robert-C.-Martin/9780132350884?redirected=true&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=Base1&utm_source=GR&utm_content=Clean-Code&selectCurrency=EUR&w=AFFMAU99Z98D6CA8VCP6&pdg=pla-317692435101:cmp-8750577997:adg-91861630761:crv-409974082492:pos-:dev-c&gclid=CjwKCAjw5vz2BRAtEiwAbcVILyvsFCl9uaMM-tipmTIGkdrYmuEjwrs9hei4ZaW6EvARtENKAiqcHxoCFXIQAvD_BwE)
