 ## uuh hi.. a little warning before reading this.

* This is a big project.

* Assignment content has nothing to do with what teacher talks about in lectures


 ## My thoughts
 
 In this assignment we had to make a system/server that will be responsible for sending music and details about artists.
 The system should work for many users at the same time. Basically this system should be a baby version of spotify.
 
 In the first part of the project you learn how to use sockets for making 2 processes communicate with each other.
 The most funny thing is that if you have never used sockets before you will have to google and debug a lot. So you have to be really patient to complete the first part of the assignment.
 
 In the seconds part you need to learn basics of android development. It will take less time than first part but if you don't spend time on it, it will not be done by itself. Nevertheless, because you are reading this it proves that you will complete your assignment without problems <3 
 

In lectures we talkes about many protocols used in distributed systems but I did not like it.
The lectures were not that good because they contained only deprecated theory without any practice.
So don't expect to learn a lot about distributed systems from this lesson.
