      <article>
        <p>In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs within computer programs, software, or systems.</p>
        <p>Although some people may love bugs (<a href="https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=27487">check this out</a>), programmers hate them</p>
        <p>Some bugs consume a lot of time which is really important if you want to be productive. In this blog post you will learn efficient techniques I use everyday as an iOS developer.</p>

        <article>
          <p>XCode is the recommended IDE by Apple. While some people say that other alternatives exists, there is no room for doubt that XCode is the way to go!</p>
          <p>XCode by default contains some debugging functionality that you can use. The most famous is the breakpoint which is used 99% of the time. <br>
            <span class="warning">Tip: Stop debugging code by using print statements because it is a bad habbit. </span>
            <code> print(result) // Never do that!!</code>

        <article>
          <p>Xcode comes with some functionalities after you hit a breakpoint. <br> Most used of them are: </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Skip <i>Used for skipping a breakpoint</i></li>
              <li>Step over <i>For running the next line of code</i></li>
              <li>Step into <i>Used for going deeper inside a method</i> </li>
              <li>Step out <i>Used for going  outside a method</i></li>
          </ol>

        <article>
          <p>View debugging is a feature Apple introduced. There is no such feature in Android yet which makes it really cool! <br> What would you do if you create a custom view and the rendered result is diferrent than expected??</p>
          <p>This is important because it helps you see what is going on in the view. See the picture below:</p>

        <header class="bigText">Advance: Conditional debugging</header>
        <article>
          <p>Did you know that you can add conditions to your breakpoint? It means that if a condition is true only then the breakpoint will be activated.</p>
          <p>You can do this by right clicking in the breakpoint and writting your condition. That condition will be evaluated at runtime which will determine if the breakpoint will be activated</p>
          <p>I use this really often when I am attaching a breakpoint in a loop</p>

        <header class="bigText">Debugging is more than finding bugs</header>
        <article>
          <p>It is really funny that some people underestimate the power of debugging.</p>
          <p>Not only is debugging used for finding bugs but it can help you understand the code</p>
          <p>Use breakpoints in your codebase and try to see what is changing and how. Believe me after this debugging will be your best friend!</p>
