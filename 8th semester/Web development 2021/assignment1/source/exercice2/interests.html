                <p> 
                    Continuous Integration and Deployment is weapon that most companies should have under their belt. <br>
                    It's really amazing how easy it is to deploy your production code with a press of a button without wasting time and effort. <br>
                    But let's not forget about CI which goes hand in hand with TDD, also known as Test Driven Development. <br>
                    CI cannot work without writting any Unit-tests and that's because it's main job is to make sure code pushed by developers do not introduce new bugs <br>
                    I'm interesting in automating CI & CD by using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane</a>.

                <p> 
                    According to statistics mobile usage have been increased by 130% at the last year. <br>
                    It's really satisfying seeing how your app can affect other people live in a meaningful way <br>

                <p> 
                    Firebase, Analytics and GCP are some products Google provide<br>
                    These tools facilitate developers in their work. <br>
                    Being the Google Developer Student Club Leader I have to admit that when people learn about these they do not want to leave them :)<br>
