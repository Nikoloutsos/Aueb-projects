links table has imdbId column that is wholly numeric (e.g. 0114709)
whereas in the movies_metadata table, there is a imdb_id that references that column which includes the numeric values preceded by 'tt' (e.g. tt0114709)

in all the tables, the actual movie id is simply "id" whereas in the links table, the actual movie id is "tmdbId"

however, in the ratings table, movieId references the exact movieId found in the links table and not tmdbId
