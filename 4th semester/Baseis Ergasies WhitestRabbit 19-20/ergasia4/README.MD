# Fourth Assignment

## CAUTION!!!
This assignment requires a lot of modifications and erasures of data from the tables. Before you start following the instructions, before you do ANYTHING in your database, 

# CREATE BACKUPS FOR ALL THE TABLES.

We were very cautious and followed the instructions step by step. What we hadn't realized, was that the steps were in such an order that caused major conflicts (for example, a column was supposed to be deleted in a table that in a later step was necessary to create another table). When you do this assignent or something relevant to this, we advise you to

# DELETE DATA ONLY AT THE VERY END.

More instructions are found in comments in the source code.
