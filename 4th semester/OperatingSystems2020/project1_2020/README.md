# Threaded-Pizza

This program utilizes the POSIX standard (mainly threads), in order to simulate a take-away pizza place, where a specified number of customers arrive one after the other and give their order to the restaurant cooks. The number of ovens and cooks is predetermined. The reason why the use of threads is essential, is because, in case all cooks are unavailable, the new customers have to wait for the previous orders to be completed, in order to give theirs. The same applies for the ovens, because, even if a pizza has already been made, the cook must wait for an oven to be freed to bake it. In addition, if two customers (a.k.a. threads) try to access the same variable at the same time (e.g. increase cook availability by one when they receive their order and leave), the output becomes invalid. For that reason, we use a certain type of lock, which guarantees that a specific customer is the only one accessing a variable at a given moment.
