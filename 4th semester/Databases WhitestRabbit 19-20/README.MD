# Databases Vassalos 2019-2020

## Description 
This repository holds all the assignments and the final project for the Databases course of the 4th semester.

We used PostgreSQL and primarily pgAdmin (a GUI for PSQL as an alternative to the CLI) to manage our database, which was not hosted locally, but on an Amazon AWS endpoint.

From an overview, this series of assignments were an amazing practice for real database design and management. From an insider's point of view, there were many flaws and errors that made our job challenging, but not a "learn through the hardships" type of challenging. More of a "annoying obstacles such as errors in the assignment description that we have to spend hours on to finish an assignment" type of challenging.

Do not be disheartened however, none of the problems that we faced had an actual effect on our grade, or the quality of our delivered work. I believe that if you follow our advice, you will handle these assignments like a pro.
