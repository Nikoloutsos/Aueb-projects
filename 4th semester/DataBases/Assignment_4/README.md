# Aueb_projects
> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

In this assignment we had to make some changes(Remove columns, add new tables) so that our database is in BCNF(Boyceâ€“Codd normal form) which is nothing more than some rules that if you follow your database will become more scalable and clean.
Understanding BCNF requires you to know 1NF,2NF,3NF(There is a pdf which explains everything about these in greek). The most important of all though is that psql documentation is well-writen so it is rather easy to learn/use new things (aggregate functions) that we did not know before.

On the other hand, if BCNF is a good practice then why Airbnb(The data that was given to us) did not use it? Is there any reason at all or our proffesor just altered it so that we have to reform it into BCNF?
