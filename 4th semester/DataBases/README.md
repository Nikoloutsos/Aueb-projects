This was one of my favorite subject so far in university. Having understood how it works, I feel so happy.
I learned how to create trigger functions and use SQL which is a powerful language when talking about handling data.
Needless to say, I also learned the basics of using AWS (Sadly it's a paid service). Maybe I will use it in the future, who knows ??, but I guess there are better alternatives to that.
Lastly, I have to admit that not knowing SQL is a drawback nowadays because almost every app has to do with some data (Either fetching it from a DB or from local caching). Now, I am able to set up my own DB (Sqlite) for saving and retrieving my project's data! (The truth is that I am using Room persistance library, yes I am an android developer ;P)
