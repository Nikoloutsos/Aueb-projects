I had never used cloud services before and I have to admit that they are awesome.
It is really interesting but it requires you to pay some money.
We created a rds(Relational database) with Postgres in aws(Amazon web services).
After that, we installed pgAdmin and we added psql so that we can do all CRUD methods in our databases. 
In my opinion, working straight from cmd with psql is way better because it's more flexible and it doesn't have bugs. On the other hand pgAdmin is more user-friendly and it represents your schema and your db in a more fancy and readable way!
