> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

In the first assignment we set up a relational database in aws(Amazon Web Services). In this assignment we got some csv(comma seperated values) files which represented tables in Airbnb relational database. What we had to do was a reverse-engineering job where we had to decide in each table what was the foreign and primary key. Then we populated our database with that data, we created an ERD, Entity Relationship Diagram, and we created a new user with only read permissions (You don't want anyone to drop your tables..believe me).
The only problem we dealt with was that the data size was quite large(400mb-500mb) and we had to wait for 1 hour until database had all the necessery data (If you wonder why..that's cause where we live the upload speed is no more than 1kbps).
