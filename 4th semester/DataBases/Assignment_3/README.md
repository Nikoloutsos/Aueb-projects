Getting your wet feet with sql statements is the best and fastest way to learn them.In this assignment we wrote 12 sql queries some of which contain outer join, aggregate functions and combination of both. The good news are that it was rather easy to find out how these concepts work as internet had plenty of free tutorials and courses to choose from(We found out that w3schools was the best place for new people learning sql).
Indeed sql is so powerful but I haven't render my final opinion yet because I need to take a look at how NoSQL and NewSQL works(who knows, they may be more efficient).
