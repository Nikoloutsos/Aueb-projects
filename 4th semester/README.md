After 10 months of learning android, I got my first job at [myconstructor](https://myconstructor.gr/)
I am really proud and I believe I have learned a myriad of new concepts during this period.
The truth is that I still have to learn a lot..
Getting your first job gives you a boost of energy and reassure you that you are on the right path for becoming a proffesional android developer.
I have been working for 3 months and day by day I see myself becoming better, enhancing my knowledge and becoming more familiar with interesting concepts. In my honest opinion the key to become better and start building awesome apps is to have patience and study as often as possible. There would always be frustrating moments but that is tottaly tottaly normal!
