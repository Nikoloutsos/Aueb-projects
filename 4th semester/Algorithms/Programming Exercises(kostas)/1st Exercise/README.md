# Aueb_projects
> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

This assignment consisted of 2 small exercises/algorithmin puzzles.
In the first one we had to create a method with complexity O(log(n)) which takes as an input an ordered array of integers and finds the first and last occurence of one integer.
In the second one we implemented one of the most popular sorting algorithms aka quicksort which is used as a default algorithm for sorting Collections in Java. In quicksort, the pivot was chosen randomly for increasing the performance.
Also, we coded some UnitTests with the Junit5 framework to make sure that everything works perfectly! Before unitTesting I was anxious about having a bug in my code, but now the anxiety has been reduced so much..!
