In this subject I learned some basics algorithms. I am not really sure where I can use them in the real world but they were quite interesting. More specifically, here are the algorithms I learned during this semester! 

| Sorting  | Graph | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Merge sort | Dijkstra  |
| Quick sort |  Bellman ford   |
| 3-way Quick sort  |  Prim|
| topological sorting  | Kruskal  |
| | BFS  |
| | DFS  |
| | Edmon's max flow  |


| Type of algoritms  |
| ------------- | 
| Bruteforce  | 
| Greedy  | 
| Dynamic programming  | 
| Divide and conquer | 

Furthermore, I understood how important is to make efficient algorithms for solving problems.
I remember me running a problem using bruteforce and it was running for 4-5 hours and then I replaced it with a greedy algorithm and the elapsed time was less than a second !! Happily, internet provide us with the best algorithms and therefore we do not have to implement our own algorithms for every problem ;)
