I'm going to be frank with you. At first glance I didn't like C++ because it was way more difficult than java. Concepts like pointers, non-virtual methods, multiple inheritance were so hard for me to digest. Maybe this is mainly because in my past I had only worked with java which is working more transarently to the user. For example every object is passed as reference but in c++ you can have it in other forms (pointer, value). The good thing is that thanks to c++ now I have a solid understanding of how java works..!
In this project we created an application that can add filters to ppm format images. Don't be amazed, it wasn't rocket science at all. The only thing that we had to do was storing the rgb values in a vector and then change it according to a filter(vector manipulation). The filter that we had to build in 1st assignment was negative.
Needless to say, we learned how pointers work and understood their real value in programming. Nevertheless, we have to admit that c++ is prone to errors comparing to java.
