In this assignment we learnt about Priorities queues and Merge sort algorithm. Needless to say, we implemented these with the use of generics(Something that was daunting at the beginning). 
One of the things that interest us the most was the trick that we used to find the median value. How did we do that? We just simply used two equal-sized priority queues ([more info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15319561/how-to-implement-a-median-heap/15319593)). With that algorithm we were able to get the median at every given time(complexity O(1)).

There is no room for doubt that this assignment enhanced our ability in solving problems that require queues and also familiarize us with java's interfaces Comperator,Comparable .
