This was my favorite exercise in DataStuctures because I learned how LRU caching works. The main Idea behind caching is that you "save" the most frequent data in a place where you access them faster than you normally would  by getting them straight from the datasource(e.g database).

We also created some Unit tests with the help of JUnit5 with the aim of making sure that the dependencies do not have any bug/problem.
Needless to say, our professor told us that the more optimized project ( the one that runs faster ) will be the winner. So we used JProfiler(Sadly it's not free) which actually shows how many times a method was called and how much time a method runs. Apparently, JProfiler has many options to choose from and it was really helpful because we made some optimizations that we wouldn't without it.
