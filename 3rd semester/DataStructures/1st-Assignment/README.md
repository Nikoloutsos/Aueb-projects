I think I am in love with Data Stuctures. In this assignment we learnt how stack and queue works and we implemented them ourselves. 
After built them, we used them to solve 2 small problems. 1) Html tag matcher which takes as an input an html file and evaluates if all the tags were matched.(To solve this we used a Stack) 2) NetBenefit which calculates the revenue of selling stocks.(We used 2 queues).
Apart from implementing these data stactures we also understood how to calculate a method's complexity which is really important for finding out which algorithm is more optimal.
