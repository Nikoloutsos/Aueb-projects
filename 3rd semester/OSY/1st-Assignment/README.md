> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

What we did build was a simple program which takes as an input 2 integers and find the GCF(Greatest Common Factor). It was rather easy and we didn't face a lot of adversities. Nevertheless, if you had any bugs it was really hard to fix it. If you want to run this you have to download SPIM.
