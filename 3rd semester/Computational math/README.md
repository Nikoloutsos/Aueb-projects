I have to admit that this subject was a little difficult. Not because its content was hard to grasp but because it had way too many ideas..(Interpolation,extrapolation,newton-cotes,richardson,linear systems, calculating integrals with numerical methods and so on...) and little concrete examples. If you ask a colleuge he will tell that this is one of the most difficult subject in CS degree program.
Having finished with this, I have to say that I learned a bunch of things and my IQ must have been increased exponentially :P 
In terms of coding, I learned how to use Octave for plotting 2D and 3D, applying math formulas like monte carlo (which is built upon python). To sum up, although I liked the things we learned cause they are interesting, the professor was not very good IMAO so I had to search everything in useful google. I have become a google master now ;P
