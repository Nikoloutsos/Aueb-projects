> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

In second semester things were getting interesting. Concepts like polymorphism,overload,override learned. 
We built AccountingDepartment APP made with java. The purpose of this app was to help businesses calculate their expenses.
Building this app, we encountered a myriad of problems but we overcame them. For example, we had to do parsing, fetching data from a txt and make POJO objects according to them!
