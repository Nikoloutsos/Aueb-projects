Time is precious especially if you don't have much of it. In this semester I didn't have enough time to study as I was focused on my part-time job and my personal life. When I just started with my first job I didn't think about this drawback because I was feeling happy for getting it. Nevertheless, I didn't give up and I studied at the last month for the exams and hopefully everything went pretty good at the end. But my advice to everyone reading this is to have a balance in his life because, in the long term, it hurts when you don't get the results that you want.
