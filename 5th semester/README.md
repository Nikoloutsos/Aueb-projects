In this semester I have to admit that the subjects required me to spend a lot of time working on homeworks. What made me mad was that some of the subjects's professors didn't really graded the final exam as they should. I know, I understand that they  have to take a look at a lot of final exam papers but it is their work and hence, they should do it carefully because it's really bad for someone to feel like an underdog..

On the other hand time is precious especially if you don't have much of it. In this semester I didn't have enough time to study as I was focused on my part-time job and my personal life. When I just started with my first job I didn't think about this drawback of not having enough time for everything because I was feeling happy for getting this job. Nevertheless, I didn't give up and I studied at the last month for the exams and hopefully everything went pretty good at the end. But my advice to everyone reading this is to have a balance in his life because, in the long term, it hurts when you don't get the results that you want.
