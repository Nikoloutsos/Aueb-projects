In this subject you are going to learn some interesting things, from statistics world, which you can use in everyday life. The most helpful tool that this subject focuses on is R programming language. I loved R because you can visualize your data and if you are a visual-learner like me you are going to love it(The same results can be achieve by using python as well so do not worry about the language). But.. I was not completely satisfied from the lessons..
Despite the interesting content of the lectures, the professor was so boring that I could not even pay attention to him.
In the end I studied everything from [khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) which is a non-profit organization which makes some good-quality educational video! 

Here is a list of what you are going to learn:
