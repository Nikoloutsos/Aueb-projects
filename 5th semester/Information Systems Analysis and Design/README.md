# Aueb_projects
> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

This subject helped me improve my skills as a project manager. It didn't contain any type of code.
More spesifically, I learned how to use UML to represent relationships (Entity-Relationship), how to divide a problem into smaller problems which have a trivial solution and then add them up to get the solution for the initial problem.
I didn't like the fact that we had a lot of homework for this subject which was consisted of large paragraphs that we had to read.Nevertheless, this subject definetly helped me improve my skills as a project manager and I believe is really helpfull for sofware engineer.
