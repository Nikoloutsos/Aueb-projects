# Aueb_projects
> ###### :octocat: This repository contains all of my projects from university ([Aueb](https://www.aueb.gr/)) .

Are you wondering what is this repo? It's nothing more than all of my projects for uni.
I am doing this just because when I finish uni I want to see what I did learn from university and if it was useful.
Apart from that, this repo may be helpful to somebody who starts studying CS at AUEB.
